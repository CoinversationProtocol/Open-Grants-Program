# W3F Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** Coinversation Protocol
- **Team Name:** Coinversation labs
- **Payment Address:** BTC, Ethereum (USDT/DAI) or Karura (kUSD) payment address. Please also specify the currency. (e.g. 0x8920... (DAI))
- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 1, 2 or 3

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
Coinversation Protocol is a stable currency protocol based on interest-bearing assets based on the parachain of Polkadot. Users can use different currencies such as CTO and DOT, etc to synthesize CUSD through smart contracts and oracle. Users can cast CUSD by staking tokens that can generate interest. Bridging USDT, USDC and other stable currencies to Coinversation to form the largest stable currency exchange platform in the Polkadot ecosystem. 

### Overview

The stablecoin created by Coinversation Protocol is decentralized, multi-asset collateralized, supports cross-chain, and supports real-world asset access through Polkadot bridge. The biggest difference between it and the past decentralized stablecoins is that there are no stability fees or interest, but stablecoins are issued in a synthetic asset collateral pool. Therefore, the cost that users pay to generate Coinversation Stablecoin (cUSD) through collateral is determined by the relative change of all synthetic assets in the entire system, rather than artificial regulations in previous decentralized stablecoins (e.g. Dai). This cost is more market-oriented, and at the same time it is equivalent to the inflation rate of stablecoin to world assets.  In general, the stable currency cUSD and the synthetic asset issuance and contract exchanges in the Coinversation Protocol constitute a complete Defi system in the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Project Details

The main functional modules of the whole system are: Mint center, Cross-chain Interest, Platform Revenue, Liquidity Mining, Liquidation, Vault.

#### Mint center
The CUSD generated by the whole system users mortgaging certain collateral. The collateral includes interest-bearing tokens such as CTO and DOT, and users can choose the proportion of CUSD they need to exchange. If stable currency is used as collateral, because it is an interest-bearing product, its leverage ratio will continue to decrease and it will never be liquidated.

#### Cross-chain Interest
When users put interest-bearing tokens such as CTO and DOT into our platform, the platform will show what chain they put into, what products they put into, and what the comprehensive rate of return is.

#### Platform Revenue
When users put in interest-bearing tokens and generate interest automatically. We will charge a certain percentage of the fee for the interest-bearing part, which we will vote on the chain to determine our percentage. This income will give dividends to $CTO collateralized users, and later we will bind with nodes and distribute rewards to users who vote for nodes. The fee for stable currency exchange will also enter the platform revenue.

#### Liquidity Mining
We will award $CTO to:
- Users who form LP on Coinversation.
- Users who form CUSD-LP
- Users who stake $CTO

#### Liquidation
The liquidator on the chain can become our liquidation robot. He will receive 5% of the total amount of liquidation as a reward. Anyone can participate in our liquidator. If bad debts occur, we will repay the entire mortgage system from the platform revenue.

#### Vault
Coinversation is a yield aggregator platform that provides DeFi users with automated compounding yields at empirically optimal intervals while pooling gas fees through smart contracts and best yield optimization strategies. Enables the highest APY on Coinversation using a proprietary dynamic harvest optimizer.


### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
